### VIS Project

This repository contains my project for the VIS course, where the primary objective was to design and implement a simple application demonstrating the use of various software design patterns. Given my experience with C# at the time, the project was developed in this language.  

#### **Project Overview**  
The application is a basic system designed to manage essential store operations, including:  
- **Selling Records**: Tracking and organizing customer sales.  
- **Shipping Details**: Maintaining records of shipping information and statuses.  
- **Administrative Tasks**: Supporting other general store management activities.  

While the application's functionality is intentionally straightforward, its primary purpose was to serve as a learning platform for applying and understanding software design patterns.  

#### **Key Features**  
- **Design Patterns**: The project incorporates several design patterns, such as Singleton, Table Data Gateway, and others, to structure and streamline the application.  
- **C# Implementation**: Developed entirely in C#, leveraging its object-oriented capabilities to illustrate the patterns effectively.  

#### **Purpose**  
This project highlights the practical use of design patterns in software development, aligning with the course's focus on teaching best practices in application design and architecture.
