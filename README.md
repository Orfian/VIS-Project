This repository contains my project for the VIS course, where the objective was to develop a simple application demonstrating the implementation of various software design patterns. Given my familiarity with C# at the time, the project was naturally developed in this language.

The application serves as a basic system for managing store operations, including tracking payment records, shipping details, and other administrative tasks. While the functionality is straightforward, the primary focus was on showcasing the practical use of design patterns, due to the requirements of the course.
